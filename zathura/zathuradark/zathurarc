# Search Highlighting
# Note: Recolor affects the base document. Highlights overlay this.
# Setting highlight color to white will make the *text* within the highlight white.

# but often appears as a slightly dimmed version or uses default system highlight.
# Let's keep these white for maximum text contrast within the highlight area.
